Please note that all code in this project has been based on code provided in cghiaus/dm4em Tutorial 3, and then adapted for use in a two room model, with incident sunlight, two windows, and an HVAC system.

"dm4em_finalcode.py" contains the full solution to all four sections, and can be accessed through the Jupyter notebook in MyBinder.
